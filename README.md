I have developed a Machine Learning project focused on the early detection and classification of cerebrovascular disorders, which are among the leading causes of disability and death globally. The project leverages patient data such as age, medical history, vital signs, and neurological assessments to train predictive models capable of identifying potential disorders like strokes or aneurysms. Using supervised learning algorithms—including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines—I aimed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support timely medical intervention. This project demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare by providing an efficient, data-driven approach to assist in clinical decision-making.
